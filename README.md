# ucd-micromouse
Sample code from a robotics project I did during my senior year at UC Davis. The objective was to build a small autonomous robot that can solve a maze on its own. I mostly worked on the software side of the project, but helped with the hardware too.

The sample code includes:
* The maze solving algorithm - "floodfill" - under the Map API folder.
* The motor control code under the Stepper Logic folder.
* An excerpt from the final report outlining how the software works.
* Supporting files to provide additional context.
